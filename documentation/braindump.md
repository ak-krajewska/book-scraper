Repo: https://github.com/bookwyrm-social

The book data schema is in two places, one the Django model and one in the ActivityPub section. I'm not sure how they fit together but it's probably a good place to look when thinking about how to structure the scraped data:

- bookwyrm/activitypub/book.py
- bookwyrm/models/book.py
