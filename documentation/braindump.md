### How the book data is structured in Goodreads

All the existing scraping scripts and the official CSV script seem to (mostly) take the data from the first book list, the "My Books" list. In my case, https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/704067?shelf=%23ALL%23

Then they also pull the generic book info, I think, that you would get from clicking the link in the "Title" field. So for the first book in my list, that would be: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35380408-the-unique-and-its-property

Somehow, the official CSV _does_ pull "My Review" which I don't think is found on that generic book info page. As far as I can tell, the review is in what I'd call the user-specific book detail page. It's weirdly difficult to get to that page even through the Goodreads GUI. 

"My Books" has the following column headers: cover, title, author, avg rating, rating, shelves, date read, date added 

At the end, there are two unlabelled columns. The first one has an "edit / view" link for each book. The last one has an X that presumably lets you delete a book. I'm not going to try it in case there's no confirmation dialogue. "Edit" takes you into a mode where you can add reviews, edit date read and so on. 

"View" takes you to the user-specific book detail page. Based on the breadcrumb, it might be the case that Goodreads attaches it to the user rather than the book. For example mine is

"Agnieszka's Reviews > The Spy Who Came in from the Cold"
https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4964829801

(I'm switching to _The Spy Who Came in from the Cold_ as my example book because it has quotes, and a review.)

Of the things that aren't included in other views, that page includes
- Started reading
- Review
- Highlights (which is a link to my quotes and notes, maybe "annotations" for short) 
- Comments other people left on the book
- Comments I might have left attached to reading progress

If I want to see the higlights, I have to go to another page, named "My Kindle Notes & Highlights." That title makes me think that Goodreads might have structured the annotations as belonging to the user and then the user's Kindle, and then the book. 

https://www.goodreads.com/notes/19847968-the-spy-who-came-in-from-the-cold/704067-agnieszka?ref=rsp

The annotations can be marked as public or private. They can be marked as spoilers. They can also have comments. 

I wish I could see the data schema that Goodreads used rather than having to reverse-engineer it. It feels that it it's something like this:

Book: Universal book object with properties that any of that book would have like:
- title
- author
- isbn

User: The individual person who has shelves, reviews, and devices
- Shelves
    - Books
    - Actions that occurred to books
        - Dates the actions occured
        - Comments associated with actions
- Reviews
    - User-created text associated with books
    - Ratings associated with books
- Devices
    - Highlights associated with books
        - Comments associated with highlights
    - Notes associated with books

I'm sure this isn't quite right, and it's not necessarily the way _I_ want the data. It might be close_ish_ to the way that Bookwyrm structures the data.

I would really love a schema diagram of the Bookwyrm data. Everybody loves an Entity Relationship Diagram. I might make one when I work my way through the code.

### Bookwyrm code

Repo: https://github.com/bookwyrm-social

The book data schema is in two places, one the Django model and one in the ActivityPub section. I'm not sure how they fit together but it's probably a good place to look when thinking about how to structure the scraped data:

- bookwyrm/activitypub/book.py
- bookwyrm/models/book.py
